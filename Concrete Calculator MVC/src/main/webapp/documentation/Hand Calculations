To compute the cost of a Concrete Slab project :

Conversions: 

Feet to yard = Feet / 3
Inches to yards = Inches / 36

CUBIC YARDS = 
Width(Yards) X Height(Yards) x Thickness(Yards)


CUBIC YARD TO BAGSIZE RATIOS = 50lb: 0.0138  60lb: 0.0167  80lb: 0.022

COST PER BAG = 80lb: $3.75  60lb: $2.83  50lb: $2.45


TOTAL COST FORMULA =

(CUBIC YARDS / CUBIC YARD TO BAGSIZE RATIOS) * COST PER BAG

NUMBER OF BAGS FORMULA = (CUBIC YARDS / CUBIC YARD TO BAGSIZE RATIOS)
